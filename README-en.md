# Assignment #1: Building a Personal Website with HTML & CSS

## Description
Create a static personal website using **HTML** and **CSS** that reflects your identity and portfolio. This website should have a **responsive**, **attractive** design that meets modern web quality standards.

## Goals
By the end of this assignment, students are expected to be able to:
- Build static web pages using semantic **HTML** and external **CSS**.
- Apply modern layout techniques using **flexbox** or **grid**.
- Create **responsive** designs that work across different screen sizes.
- Use **Git** in a structured way: creating branches, writing descriptive commit messages, and merging changes via Pull Requests.
- Publish a website to the internet using a free **hosting** service.
- Ensure code quality through **validation** and basic **accessibility** standards.

## Specifications

### 1. Page Structure (At Least 3 Pages)
- **Home Page (index.html)**: Contains a brief introduction, profile picture, and self-description.
- **Portfolio Page (portfolio.html)**: Displays projects or past experiences.
- **Contact Page (contact.html)**: Contains a contact form (does not need to be functional, design only).

### 2. Required HTML Elements
- Use **header, nav, main, footer** semantically.
- Navigation between pages must work.
- Every page must include the following meta tags inside `<head>`:
  ```html
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="Brief description of this page">
  ```
- Include a **favicon** (the small icon that appears in the browser tab).

### 3. Style and Appearance (CSS)
- Use **external CSS** (separate `.css` file).
- Utilize **flexbox or grid** for layout.
- Apply consistent colors, fonts, and spacing.
- Use **Google Fonts** or icons from **FontAwesome**.
- **Responsive** (use media queries at least for mobile and desktop views).
- Hover effects or simple **animations** using CSS.
- Do not use **inline styles** (`style="..."`) — all styles must be in the external CSS file.

### 4. Code Quality
- File and folder names must use **lowercase letters** and **no spaces** (use `-` as separator, e.g. `about-me.html`, `style/main.css`).
- HTML and CSS must **pass validation** using:
  - [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- Include screenshots of the validation results in `REPORT.md`.

### 5. Accessibility (a11y)
- All `<img>` elements must have a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- Text and background color contrast must be sufficient (minimum ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text).
- All navigation must be accessible using the keyboard (Tab key).

### 6. Deployment (Required)
- **Host the website online** using **GitHub Pages**, Netlify, or Vercel.
- Include the link to the hosted website in `REPORT.md`.

### 7. Bonus (Optional)
- Dark mode toggle.
- **Lighthouse score ≥ 80** in the **Performance** and **Accessibility** categories (include a screenshot in `REPORT.md`).

## Submission via GitHub Classroom

> **Individual assignment.** Each student works on their own repository provided by GitHub Classroom.

### 0. Prerequisite: SSH Setup on GitHub
Before you start, make sure you have configured an SSH key on GitHub so you can `git push` without entering your password every time.

1. Generate an SSH key (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
   ```
2. Copy the contents of the public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**.
3. Test the connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   If successful, you will see: `Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...`
4. Clone the repository using the **SSH** URL (not HTTPS):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:....git
   ```

### 1. GitHub Repository
- Ensure all project files are stored and **submitted** in the repository provided through **GitHub Classroom**.
- The directory structure must be neat and easy to understand.
- It is recommended to **create a branch** (e.g. `dev` or `feature/feature-name`) and merge it into `main` via a **Pull Request** on GitHub.
- Make **regular** and descriptive **commits** — **at least 5 meaningful commits** (not just one large commit at the end).

#### Commit Message Format
Use the **Conventional Commits** format below:

| Prefix | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `feat:` | adding a new feature or page |
| `fix:` | fixing a bug or visual issue |
| `style:` | CSS changes without affecting functionality |
| `docs:` | changes to `REPORT.md` or other documentation |
| `chore:` | general tasks (adding images, favicon, etc.) |

Examples of good commit messages:
```
feat: add portfolio page with grid layout
fix: fix navigation not responsive on mobile
style: adjust header color and typography
docs: add W3C validation screenshots to report
```

### 2. Report in Markdown Format (`REPORT.md`)
Create a `REPORT.md` file in the repository containing:
- **Project description** (purpose, main features, technologies used).
- **Project folder and file structure**.
- **Link to the hosted website** (required).
- **Screenshot proving SSH is configured** (output of the `ssh -T git@github.com` command).
- **Screenshots of W3C HTML and CSS validation results**.
- **Lighthouse screenshot** (if completing the bonus).
- The report format should be clear and readable.

## Submission Deadline
- Friday, **May 8, 2026** at 23.59 WIB.
